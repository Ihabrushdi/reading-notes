Markdown on GitHub
Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

Getting Started with GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.
Create Your Website
Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.
On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
Making Changes
One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main.
View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.
