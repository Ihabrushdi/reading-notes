New Html5 Layout Elements
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content,you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
Linking Around Block-Level Elements HTML5 allows web page authors
to place an <a> element around a block level element that
contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block
into a link.
Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.
The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
X The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,which is available free from Google

Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
