What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

GitHub Markdown Syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
Headings;To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
Lists, You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.
Mentioning people and teams
You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name.
